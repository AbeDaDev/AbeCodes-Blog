💼 Developer Portfolio (v1)

This was the first version of my personal developer portfolio, built to showcase my early projects, skills, and growth as a web developer. It served as a foundational project where I practiced building a fully custom website from scratch—handling everything from layout to responsive design and project presentation.

While it may not be as polished as my newer version, it represents an important step in my journey and reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and self-driven learning.

I plan to continue refining this portfolio to better reflect my skills and ensure that every part of it—from design to code—is fully my own work.

Currently I am integrating Vite & React
