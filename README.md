💼 Developer Portfolio (v1)

This was the first version of my personal developer portfolio, built to showcase my early projects, skills, and growth as a web developer. It served as a foundational project where I practiced building a fully custom website from scratch—handling everything from layout to responsive design and project presentation.

While I since made a new portfolio website, this page has now been turned into a personal Blog page about my Journey. The page is still under construction.
